    <h3>A little bit about..</h3>
    <hr>

    <p>I am a professional with over 10 years of experience in auditing, consulting, managing and executing projects related to IT and Business areas. I am used to working on multiple projects in parallel, while demonstrating flexibility, as
      clients
      refine their requirements and organizing workload, to ensure that different client deadlines were met.
      <br> <em> During the recent years I specialized in assisting large and complex organizations who undergo a process of significant changes in their IT environment. </p>
